# ML_corner
My ML corner -- various experiments using: e.g. tensorflow

Experiments are sorted in chronological (to remind myself) from start - current, as follows:
1. [HelloWorld -- Iris](https://github.com/affNVu/ML_corner/tree/master/HelloWorld_Iris), this was done following a tutorial from [Machine learning mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/hello-world-of-applied-machine-learning/). Algorithms used including LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, etc.
2. [MNIST](https://github.com/affNVu/ML_corner/tree/master/MNIST), using LogisticRegression with softmax; a simple few hidden layers neural network; a convolutional neural network. The codes used here are adapated from Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course from coursera. The convnet model achieves an accuracy of 98.842% on Kaggle.
3. To be cont.
