    Returns a model for the purpose of 'painting' the picture.
    Takes only the convolution layer weights and wrap using the TensorFlow
    Conv2d, Relu and AveragePooling layer. VGG actually uses maxpool but
    the paper indicates that using AveragePooling yields better results.
    The last few fully connected layers are not used.

    Comment: the VGG16 is a little bit tricky to acccess 
    To access the collection of layers, do: vgg_layers[0], then vgg_layers[0].shape = 43
    To access ith each layer, do: layer = vgg_layers[0][i][0][0]
    Now each layer is a numpy.void type for flexbility. For each layer, the array contains:
        [0]: name of layer i.e. conv1_1
        [1]: (not sure) type e.g. conv for convolute
        [2]: contains both the weight matrix e.g. layer[2][0] and bias e.g. layer[2][1]
        [3]: the shape of layer, 
        [4]: stride (if applicable)
